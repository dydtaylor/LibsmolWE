Quickstart guide for getting LibsmolWE running

1. First, the user will need to install Smoldyn from http://www.smoldyn.org/download.html.
	
	a. You will need the complete distribution with source code, not the pre-compiled software.
	
	b. The version of Smoldyn used in the paper is Smoldyn 2.62. Major changes to Smoldyn that might impact these results would be how Smoldyn handles 2D molecular reactions, specifically A+A <-> B reactions. Steve Andrews mentioned in Chapter 2 of his SmolEmulate document, that reaction rate functions have "several problems, some dating back to [the] original 2004 algorithms and some in new algorithms".
	
	c. The authors of LibsmolWE attempted to select reaction parameters that lie outside of the problematic regions mentioned in "SmolEmulateDoc.pdf", so hopefully minor changes have no impact on the results for 2d binding.
	
	d. Installation should install the libsmoldyn, smoldyn, smoldynconfigre, libsmoldyn_static.a and libsmoldyn_shared.dylib libraries to the users local folder so that Smoldyn can be called as a library.
	
2. Update the makefile with your own Smoldyn library locations. The makefile uses dynamic linking rather than static. This should create the executable "weSmoldyn". Linking properly has 2 steps.
	a. First, you need to update the second line of the makefile: gcc weSmoldyn.o -o weSmoldyn -L/YOUR_LIBRARY_LOCATION -lsmoldyn_shared -lm
		i.YOUR_LIBRARY_LOCATION is the location of libsmoldyn_shared.so (or libsmoldyn_shared.dylib libsmoldyn_shared.dll depending on OS). You can find this quickly on linux/mac with the command sudo find / -name libsmoldyn_shared.so
	b. Second, prior to every execution you need to set your library path variable: use the following commands to do so:
		LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/YOUR/LIBRARY/LOCATION
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	c. In instances where you do not have sudo privileges, the libsmoldyn_shared.so file can be placed in any directory (or taken from the smoldyn-2.66/cmake directory). Just use one of those locations for YOUR_LIBRARY_LOCATION.

3. Execute the following via terminal / command line (in the folder with weSmoldyn, binDefinitions.txt, binParams.txt, corralsParams.txt, dynamicsParams.txt, ISEED, and WEParams.txt)
	./weSmoldyn simState.txt simFluxes.txt simSeed.txt 0 simTime.txt 0
	
	a. If you want to create identical data sets, disable the RNG seed cycling by changing the bit in the command-line argument
		The new command should be:
		./weSmoldyn simState.txt simFluxes.txt simSeed.txt 1 simTime.txt 0
	b. If you want to continue from where a previous sim ended, enable the savestate bit at the end of the command. The new 		command should be:
		./weSmoldyn simState.txt simFluxes.txt simSeed.txt 0 simTime.txt 1
		
4. To evaluate the data, run the MATLAB script quickstart.m in the same folder where the commands were executed.
